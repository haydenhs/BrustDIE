Brust Dark Image Enhancement

## Outline
We aim to use deep learning to boost dark image quality.

Dark burst images suffer from the following artifects

* demosaicing
* read-and-shot noise
* color distortion

## Work finished

* training code
* miika's work on permutation invariant CNN 
* Switch to LMDB data format
* support multi-GPU training

## Todo list

* add test code
* add evaluation code
* add KPN model
* support PSNR/SSIM quality indices
* support different burst size
